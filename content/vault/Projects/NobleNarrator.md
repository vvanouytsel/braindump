## Chronicle

The goal is to have the user click a 'create chronicle' button which creates a chronicle story of the current ruler. The name, title and backstory of the ruler is included in the beginning of the chronicle. All recorded past events are summarized and a story is created out of them. The story is then formatted and is stored in a PDF file.

As we ventured deeper into the scorching jungle of Raisin, a relentless swarm of tiny, dark insects buzzed around us like a malevolent cloud. Their very presence seemed to draw life force from my body, leaving me feeling drained and helpless. The horses, too, were afflicted by the insidious pests, their normally proud manes now dulled by the sticky residue of these bloodthirsty creatures. My wife Sankaradevi, usually a pillar of strength, was beside herself with frustration as she wildly flailed her arms in an attempt to shake off the relentless attackers. The air was thick with the acrid scent of insect repellents and sweat as we struggled to make our way through the treacherous terrain. It was as if the very gods themselves had conspired against us, sending this plague of tiny terrors to torment us on our journey. As the sun beat down upon us like a hammer, I couldn't help but wonder how much more of this torture we could endure before succumbing to the merciless heat and relentless assault of these biting pests.

## Enable Systemd-resolved

- Use the local stub file used by systemd

```bash
# Symlink /etc/resolv.conf to the stub file
$ ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

- Configure the local stub file using systemd-resolved

```bash
# Configure DNS servers
$ vim /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dns_servers.conf

[Resolve]
DNSSEC=no
Cache=yes
DNS=8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8
Domains=company.net
DNSStubListener=yes
```

- Restart systemd-resolved

```bash
$ systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

- Check if the nameservers are used

```bash
$ systemd-resolved --status

Global
         DNS Servers: 8.8.4.4
                      8.8.8.8
```

## Disable Systemd-resolved

- Use resolv.conf, not managed by systemd-resolved

```bash
# Remove symlink to the stub file
$ rm -rf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
```
